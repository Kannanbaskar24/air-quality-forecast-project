1. README.md ✅

Purpose: Introduce the project, explain installation, usage, and deployment.

Location: Root folder (AirAware/README.md)

Status: ✅ Completed

Content Includes:

Project overview

Installation instructions (Python venv, dependencies)

Running instructions (Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI API)

Docker deployment

Project structure description

Admin panel functionalities

2. Architecture Diagram ✅

Purpose: Visualize data flow from sources → model → API → database → dashboard

Location: docs/architecture_diagram.png

Status: ✅ Completed

Content:

Data Sources (CPCB/OpenAQ) → Preprocessing → Models (ARIMA/LSTM/etc.)
     ↓                                   ↓
   Database ← Predictions & Alerts ← Logging / Drift Detection
     ↓
   API (FastAPI)
     ↓
   Dashboard (Streamlit)

3. Database Schema Diagram ✅

Purpose: Show database tables and relationships

Location: docs/db_schema.png

Status: ✅ Completed

Tables:

measurements → raw/cleaned data

predictions → model forecasts

alerts → high-risk days

models → model metadata

Relationships:

measurements.station_id → predictions.station_id (one-to-many)

predictions.station_id → alerts.station_id (one-to-many)

predictions.model_name → models.model_name (one-to-many)

4. Model Cards ✅

Purpose: Provide metadata for each model

Location: models/

Example filenames:

models/model_card_PM25.json

models/model_card_PM10.json

Example JSON content:

{
  "model_name": "PM2.5 LSTM",
  "type": "LSTM Time Series",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "training_date": "2025-09-20",
  "MAE": 5.2,
  "RMSE": 6.8
}


Status: ✅ Completed
